# Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is an **interactive Data Visualization Dashboard** built with **Python, Streamlit, Pandas, and Plotly**. It allows users to explore real-world data (Gapminder dataset) with interactive filters and dynamic charts.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Interactive **filters** (Year & Continent)
- **Scatter plot** of GDP vs Life Expectancy
- **Pie chart** of Population by Continent
- **Line chart** showing Life Expectancy trends
- Expandable **data table** to view filtered results
- Built with **Streamlit** for an easy-to-use dashboard

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** → For building the dashboard UI
- **Pandas** → For data cleaning & manipulation
- **Plotly** → For interactive visualizations

streamlit==1.37.0
pandas==2.2.2
plotly==5.23.0
```

## 📊 How It Works
1. User selects a **year** and **continent(s)** from the sidebar.
2. Data is filtered dynamically using **Pandas**.
3. Visualizations update instantly:
   - Scatter plot → GDP vs Life Expectancy
   - Pie chart → Population distribution by continent
   - Line chart → Life Expectancy over time
